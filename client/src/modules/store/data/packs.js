By default, the compute estate runs on two general economy nodes (7.5 GiB, 4 CPUs), with an option to select durable nodes instead. Autoscaling is enabled to shut down idle nodes (a minimum of one compute node will be retained at all times). The cluster operates the Slurm Workload Manager job scheduler.\n\nThis paragraph is only *here* to test **markdown** `rendering`.

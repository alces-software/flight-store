  details: |
    A cluster comprising an entry-level login node and general-level compute
    nodes (3.75 GiB, 2 CPUs) provided for familiarization and experimentation
    with Alces Flight Compute. By default, the compute estate runs on two
    general economy nodes (7.5 GiB, 4 CPUs), with an option to select durable
    nodes instead. Autoscaling is enabled to shut down idle nodes (a minimum
    of one compute node will be retained at all times). The cluster operates
    the Slurm Workload Manager job scheduler.

  features:
    - Medium-sized login node and balanced compute nodes (60 GiB, 36 CPUs).
    - Autoscales from a single compute node to four balanced compute nodes
      (240GiB, 144 CPUs).

  details: |
    A cluster comprising a medium-sized login node and balanced compute nodes
    (60 GiB, 36 CPUs) providing enhanced performance for workloads with higher
    processing, memory and networking requirements. The compute estate
    initially runs as a single node, with autoscaling enabled provide up to
    four balanced compute nodes (240 GiB, 144 CPUs). The cluster operates the
    Open Grid Scheduler (SGE) job scheduler.
